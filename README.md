# Anime Platform

## How to run

Dockerization currently not working so it's a bit more complicated to run.

## Backend set up

Environment values that need to be set up in order for the backend to work are:

- JWT_SECRET (a random/long string of characters is good enough)
- MONGODB_LINK

## TODOS

- Switch from storing token in localStorage to cookies
